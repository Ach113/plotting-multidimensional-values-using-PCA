# plotting-multidimensional-values-using-PCA
Program extracts information from csv file which contains house data of 9 features and a price corresponding to those features
since matrix x of dimensions (1700, 9) cannot be plotted against y matrix (1700, 1) I used PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
to reduce the input dimension and plot the feature vs outcome on the graph
